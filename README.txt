# This is a R script to collect data of interest (Twitter) and to save it to disk.
#The data will be formatted as JSON objects (most likely), so  a second script to import the JSON objects is written, 
previously saved to disk by the first script, into R structures for analysis. 
#OAuth Authentication keys are required to access twitter API.
#The folders from problem 2 to 4 contain EDA performed on different datasets. The Datasets used are provided in the corresponding folders.
#The last folder contains a script for a RShiny interface.
